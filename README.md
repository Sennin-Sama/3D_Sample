# 3D_Sample
Some basic Samples of what i have been working on 
I started working with blender around 3 years ago 
I learend some basic rigging and naimating and started working on 3D modeling and animating skills
I still havent made it to textures for 3D but I can model and animate quite well 
I might lack some professional skills since i am mostly self taught and learned form youtube and AI help
